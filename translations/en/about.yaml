  `@Legend of the Green Dragon`nBy Eric Stevens & JT Traub`0`n`n
version: |
  `c`@LotGD version `@%s`0`c
introduction: |
  `@MightyE tells you, "`2Legend of the Green Dragon is a remake of and homage to the classic BBS Door game, Legend of the Red Dragon (aka LoRD) by <a href='http://www.rtsoft.com' target='_blank'>Seth Able Robinson</a>.`@"
  `n`n`@"`2LoRD is now owned by Gameport (<a href='http://www.gameport.com/bbs/lord.html' target='_blank'>http://www.gameport.com/bbs/lord.html</a>), and they retain exclusive rights to the LoRD name and game.
  That's why all content in Legend of the Green Dragon is new, with only a very few nods to the original game, such as the buxom barmaid, Violet, and the handsome bard, Seth.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2Although serious effort was made to preserve the original feel of the game, numerous departures were taken from the original game to enhance playability, and to adapt it to the web.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2LoGD (after version 0.9.7) is released under a <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/' target='_blank'>Creative Commons License</a>, which essentially means that the source code to the game, and all derivatives of the game must remain open and available upon request.
  Version 0.9.7 and before are still available under the <a href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html' target='_blank'>GNU General Public License</a> though 0.9.7 will be the last release under that license.
  To use any of the new features requires using the 1.0.0 code.  You may explicitly not place code from versions after 0.9.7 into 0.9.7 and release the combined derivative work under the GPL.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2You may download the latest official version of LoGD at <a href='http://dragonprime.net/' target='_blank'>DragonPrime</a>  and you can play the Classic version at <a href='http://lotgd.net/'>http://lotgd.net</a>.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2You should attempt to use this code only if you are comfortable with PHP and MySQL and willing to manually keep your code up to date.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2Additionally, there is an active modder community located at <a href='http://dragonprime.net' target='_blank'>DragonPrime</a> which may help you find additional features which you may wish to add to your game.
  For these additional features you will find active support within the DragonPrime community.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2LoGD is programmed in PHP with a MySQL backend. It is known to run on Windows and Linux with appropriate setups.
  The core code has been actively written by Eric Stevens and JT Traub, with some pieces by other authors (denoted in the source at these locations), and the code has been released under a <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/' target='_blank'>Creative Commons License</a>.
  Users of the source are bound to the terms therein.`n
  The DragonPrime Development Team took over responsibility for code development on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2006 and continues to maintain and add to features of the core code.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2Users of the source are free to view and modify the source, but original copyright information, and original text from the about page must be preserved, though they may be added to.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2We hope you enjoy the game!`@"`n`n<hr>`n
license: |
  `@MightyE tells you, "`2We're going to take a few moments to try and explain this new license and the reasons behind it in plain English.
  The legalese for the license can be found online at <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/legalcode' target='_blank'>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/legalcode</a> and should be read and understood in detail before you use this code.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2This new license was chosen because of a failing with the GPL.
  It only covered distribution of source if and only if binaries were distributed.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2In a web environment, specifically an interpreted web environment such as PHP, merely installing a game does not constitute distribution, and therefore people were taking our work, making modifications to it and not releasing the source code to their modifications so that the entire community could benefit.
  They worked with the letter but not the spirit of the law.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2Investigation on the part of the authors however, led to the fact that the right of public performance was one of the rights normally restricted to copyright holders, AND that computer programs, specifically video games and interactive ones such as Legend of the Green Dragon were considered to be publically performed if run from a public server.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2The new license restricts public performance of the work unless the source code of the modified work is made available on demand.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2In plain English, this means that if you put this game on a web server and allow people 'outside of a normal circle of family and its social acquaintances' to play there, then you are publically performing this work and MUST either a) make any and ALL changes which you make to the game available on request (note this doesn't have to be available via the online source display link, but they must be able to ask you for the code AND receive a complete copy), b) make arrangements privately with the authors wherein they grant you a special license, or c) remove the code entirely from the machine.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2We do recognize that people want to have areas of their game which are theirs and theirs alone.
  To that end we will make the following exception to the normal requirements for source code distribution -- any module file which is not modified or derived from a module file included in the base distribution AND which does not require any other modules AND which does not require any modifications to the core code (code distributed with the base release) may be withheld at the authors discretion.`@"`n`n
  `@"`2We also want to make very clear that version 0.9.7 (also known as version 0.9.7+jt) was the final version released under the GPL.
  All versions, starting with the 0.9.8-prerelease code are only licensed under the Creative Commons license.
  We EXPLICITLY deny the right to import any code from a 0.9.8-prerelease or later release into a 0.9.7 and earlier release.
  Allowing this would cause that imported code to be released under the GPL and that is not something we wish to allow.
  Authors of modifications to 0.9.7 will need to re-release their modifications as derivatives/modifications to 0.9.8 code and place them under the same Creative Commons license.
  It must be done by the original author since only the original author has the right to change the copyright or license upon their work.
  [Additionally, reworking the modifications will be a good idea anyway as the mechanism for making modifications is substantially cleaner/clearer starting with the 0.9.8-prerelease code.]`@"
