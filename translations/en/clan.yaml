  `%%s`7 accepts your application, files it in her out box, and folds her hands 
  on the desk, staring at you. You stand there staring blankly back at her for a 
  few minutes before she suggests that perhaps you'd like to take a seat in the 
  waiting area.

  `7You ask %s`7 for a clan membership application form. She opens a drawer in 
  her desk and pulls out a form.  It contains only two lines: Name and Clan 
  Name. You furrow your brow, not sure if you really like having to deal with 
  all this red tape, and get set to concentrate really hard in order to complete 
  the form. Noticing your attempt to write on the form with your %s, %s`7 
  claims the form back from you, writes %s`7 on the first line, and asks you 
  the name of the clan that you'd like to join:`n`n

introduction: |
  `7You stand in the center of a great marble lobby filled with pillars.
  All around the walls of the lobby are various doors which lead to
  various clan halls. The doors each possess a variety of intricate
  mechanisms which are obviously elaborate locks designed to be opened
  only by those who have been educated on how to operate them. Nearby,
  you watch another warrior glance about nervously to make sure no one
  is watching before touching various levers and knobs on the door. With
  a large metallic "chunk" the lock on the door disengages, and the
  door swings silently open, admitting the warrior before slamming shut.
  `n`n
  In the center of the lobby sits a highly polished desk, behind which
  sits `%%s`7, the clan registrar. She can take your filing for a new
  clan, or accept your application to an existing clan.`n`n
