travel_warning: |
  `%Travelling the world can be a dangerous occupation. Although other 
  villages might offer things not found in your current one, getting from 
  village to village is no easy task, and might subject you to various 
  dangerous creatures or brigands. Be sure you're willing to take on the 
  adventure before you set out, as not everyone arrives at their destination 
  intact. Also, pay attention to the signs, some roads are safer than others.`n

    `n`n`c`bQuestions about the multiple village system`b`c`n
    `^1. Why, oh why did you activate such a (choose one [wondrous, horrible]) feature?`n
    `@For kicks, of course. We like to mess with your head.`n
    But seriously, have you looked at the user list?  On lotgd.net, we've 
    got over 6,000 people cramming themselves into the Village Square and 
    trying to get their voices heard! Too much! Too much!`n
    In the interests of sanity, we've made more chat boards. And in the 
    interests of game continuity, we've put them into separate villages 
    with many cool new features.`n`n
    If you are a smaller server, this might not be right for you, but we 
    think it works okay there too.`n`n
    `^2. How do I go to other villages?`n
    `@Walk, skate, take the bus...`n
    Or press the Travel link (in the City Gates or Village Gates category) 
    in the navigation bar.`n`n
    `^3. How does travelling work?`n
    `@Pretty well, actually. Thanks for asking.`n
    You get some number of  free travels per day (%s on this server) in 
    which you can travel to any other village you want.
    Also, it is possible for the admin to give additional free travels 
    with some mounts.
    After that, you use up one forest fight per travel.
    After that...well, we hope you like where you end up.
    Since all major economic transactions come through `Q%s`@ (the capital 
    of the region), the roads to and from there have been fortified to 
    protect against monsters from wandering onto them.
    That was a while back though, and the precautions are no longer perfect.`n
    Travel between the other villages have no such precautions.`n
    In either case, you might want to heal yourself before travelling. 
    You have been warned.`n`n
    `^4. Where's (the Inn, the forest, my training master, etc.)?`n
    `@Look around. Do you see it? No? Then it's not here.`n
    The problem's usually:`n
    a) It's actually there, you just missed it the first time around.`n
    b) It's in another village, try travelling.`n
    c) It's not on this server, check out the modules installed on this 
    server in the About link on the login page.`n
    d) Are you sure you didn't just see that feature in a dream?`n`n
    `^5. I've used up my free travels and forest fights. How do I travel now?`n
    `@We hope you like where you've ended up, because you're stuck there until 
    the next new day.`n`n
    `^6. Can I pay for more travels?`n
    `@Maybe, check out the Hunter's Lodge.
