  `6As you approach the pair of impressive carved rock crystal doors,
  they part to allow you entrance into the bank. You find yourself standing
  in a room of exquisitely vaulted ceilings of carved stone. Light filters
  through tall windows in shafts of soft radiance. About you, clerks are
  bustling back and forth. The sounds of gold being counted can be heard,
  though the treasure is nowhere to be seen.`n`n

  You walk up to a counter of jet black marble.`n`n

  {{common.names.banker}}`6, a petite woman in an immaculately tailored business dress,
  greets you from behind reading spectacles with polished silver frames.`n`n

  `6"`5Greetings, my good lady,`6" you greet her, "`5Might I inquire
  as to my balance this fine day?`6"`n`n

  see...`6" she mutters as she scans down a page in her ledger.`0
